## Development

To further develop unittest within this repository, build a new class with the following body.

```python
import random
import platform
import unittest
import warnings
from loguru import logger

from selenium import webdriver


class ExampleTests(unittest.TestCase):

    def setUp(self) -> None:
        # Declare your setup and configuration here
        warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=DeprecationWarning)
        if platform.system() == "Darwin":
            self.driver = webdriver.Safari()
        else:
            self.driver = webdriver.Chrome("chromedriver.exe")

        # Data
        # Declare your required data for the test here

        # xPaths and Reference
        # Declare your xPaths and references here

        # Etc.
        self.context = {}

    def test_case_a(self):
        # Test Case A
        pass
    
    def test_case_b(self):
        # Test Case B
        pass
    
    def tearDown(self) -> None:
        # Declare your exit here
        pass
```
